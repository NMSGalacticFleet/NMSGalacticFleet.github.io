It also serves as a way to give exact location information of a system in a short form that can be used inside a system name. See <a href="./naming">naming guidelines</a> or watch this <a href="https://youtu.be/NVvuGCMsKGg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">YouTube video</a> for how to use them.</p><p>The naming guidelines are <strong>mandatory</strong> within our 7 regions. Players who don&#39;t wish to follow the naming guidelines should not upload systems in Eisvana.</p><p>If you are not sure if you are doing it correctly, ask a Mentor in the Eisvana Discord. Once a system is renamed, it cannot be changed again, so better double check than making a mistake.</p><p>You can use the <a href="https://eisvana.github.io/Eisvana-System-Naming-Tools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Eisvana System Naming Tools</a> to generate the prefix for your current system, and also to practice the naming.</p><h2 id="how-do-i-become-a-citizen" tabindex="-1">How do I become a Citizen? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-i-become-a-citizen" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How do I become a Citizen?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Fill out our <a href="https://census.eisvana.com/form.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">census form</a>.

Join a department and learn wiki documentation, taxi people to our space as a Vana Van, fly through space and take breathtaking screenshots to fill our Discord channels, expand our lore, or just talk to others on the Discord. It&#39;s up to you what you want to do, there is no clear path. Most important is that you have fun!</p><h3 id="participation-and-community-projects" tabindex="-1">Participation and Community Projects <a class="header-anchor" href="#participation-and-community-projects" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Participation and Community Projects&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Eisvana should be a place where you can grow and unleash your potential. We are very open to new ideas and you&#39;ll be supported in all your endeavours!</p><p>Our Discord server has a dedicated <strong>#participation-board</strong> channel for suggestions and community projects. Anyone can participate there. We are open to all kinds of suggestions, be it new colonies, events, structural changes for the civ, etc. It is also strongly encouraged to get directly involved, for example by spearheading a new colony or organising an event!</p><p>Community building projects are separated into the <strong>#construction-projects</strong> channel. Everyone can take part in these builds. If you want to do a themed group of bases, work together on one shared base, etc. feel free to post there!</p><h3 id="voting" tabindex="-1">Voting <a class="header-anchor" href="#voting" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Voting&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Eisvana is a semi-democratic civ. This means that most decisions may be brought to the community for discussion and vote. This may include structural changes, but also decisions like where to put the next colony.</p><p>The place to vote is the <strong>#votes</strong> forum channel in the Eisvana Discord.

If multiple people are interested in the same position, a new department may be created. Manager roles can be created as needed, there is no fixed set of roles.
