I have been playing NMS for roughly 4 years now, and have spent the majority of that time learning how to glitch build. Im very much behind on the new gameplay, I still havent met an autophage and I have no idea what a dreadnought looks like. Im like a hermit on my building planets, I only look up when I need something!</p><h2 id="gameplay-interests" tabindex="-1">Gameplay Interests <a class="header-anchor" href="#gameplay-interests" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Gameplay Interests&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I build spaceships and other various bits and bobs from popular sci fi and fantasy tv/films, and I really enjoy bringing those things into a space where folks can interact with them. So far I&#39;ve built several star trek ships, I led a project to reimagine the Thunderbirds and I have several builds in the pipeline.</p><p>I have a half built Jaeger called Pacific Jim that haunts me.</p><h2 id="departments" tabindex="-1">Departments <a class="header-anchor" href="#departments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Departments&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I am a member of the Eisvana Building Collective.</p><h2 id="contact" tabindex="-1">Contact <a class="header-anchor" href="#contact" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Contact&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I have a 2-5 day response to messages, its either immediately or in a weeks time, but discord is fine for a message.
