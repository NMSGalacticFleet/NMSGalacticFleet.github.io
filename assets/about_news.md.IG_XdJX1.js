We have achieved a lot in the past year. We discovered all our star systems, started several building projects and colonies, made our own web apps, added more ways for our citizens to contribute, the list goes on. And we also managed to become one of the biggest civilizations in Eissentam within this year, with over 50 registered citizens! Eisvana stands for community involvement. All these achievements wouldn&#39;t have been possible without our awesome community! Thanks to everyone who&#39;s part of Eisvana! There are still a lot of ideas floating around, probably enough to fill the next 10 years! Onto a successful second year!</p><h2 id="new-capital-planet-18-september-2024" tabindex="-1">New Capital Planet (18 September 2024) <a class="header-anchor" href="#new-capital-planet-18-september-2024" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;New Capital Planet (18 September 2024)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The Worlds Part I update turned our old capital planet Accordia into a purple swamp. After a lot of searching, we voted on a new capital planet: <a href="https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/New_Accordia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">New Accordia</a>! The planet can be found at this address: <span class="glyphs">406CA21107FF</span></p><h2 id="embassy-planet-18-september-2024" tabindex="-1">Embassy Planet (18 September 2024) <a class="header-anchor" href="#embassy-planet-18-september-2024" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Embassy Planet (18 September 2024)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Eisvana now has an official embassy planet: <a href="https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Avalonis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Avalonis</a>. Ambassadors from other civilizations and communities are encouraged to build their embassy on this planet or in the surrounding region &quot;Imnito&quot;, which acts as our embassy region.</p><p>The planet took the second place in the capital planet vote. To not leave it unused, we decided to turn it into our embassy planet.</p><h2 id="themed-regions-18-september-2024" tabindex="-1">Themed Regions (18 September 2024) <a class="header-anchor" href="#themed-regions-18-september-2024" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Themed Regions (18 September 2024)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In order to better tie our lore and regions together, we are introducing regional themes! Each region also has a regional centre system that hosts something special related to the region&#39;s theme. We&#39;re starting with three regions, but it&#39;s planned to expand this to the other regions as well.</p><p>The themes do not strictly dictate what happens in a specific region, but rather set a rough guideline for worldbuilding purposes. So for example, if we declare a region as a &quot;farming&quot; region, farms can still be built outside of that region, and bases that aren&#39;t farms can also still be built in that region. But if you want to build a farm and don&#39;t know where, this might be a good guidance to narrow down the location.</p><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th>Region</th><th>Theme</th><th>Theme Description</th><th>Regional Centre</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Flinus</td><td>Lore</td><td>Lore-relevant builds (Beetle shrines, etc.)</td><td>EV1-10 Dabri</td></tr><tr><td>Imnito</td><td>Embassy</td><td>Other civilizations&#39; embassies</td><td><a href="https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/EV2-5D_Veridia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">EV2-5D Veridia</a></td></tr><tr><td>Cuynteto</td><td>Capital</td><td>Most populated region</td><td><a href="https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/EV5-6C_Clarity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">EV5-6C Clarity</a></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="atlas-app-18-september-2024" tabindex="-1">Atlas App (18 September 2024) <a class="header-anchor" href="#atlas-app-18-september-2024" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Atlas App (18 September 2024)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>All star systems in Eisvana are discovered since 22 July 2024. To get a better overview over how much and what has been discovered where, when and by whom, we made a new web app: The <a href="https://eisvana.github.io/Eisvana-Discovery-Data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Atlas App</a>. It lists all star systems, planets, creatures, minerals, plants, settlements and bases, as well as their discoverer and the discovery date. The data can also be filtered. And on top of that, it also shows detailed statistics and charts made from this data. For example who discovered the most, when have the most discoveries been made, or how successful we are at properly renaming systems. The data will be continuously updated.</p><h2 id="census-management-tool-17-april-2024" tabindex="-1">Census Management Tool (17 April 2024) <a class="header-anchor" href="#census-management-tool-17-april-2024" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Census Management Tool (17 April 2024)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Our new <a href="https://eisvana.github.io/Eisvana-Census" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Census Management Tool</a> is now live. It is probably <em>the</em> most advanced census tool in all of civilized space, allowing for applications, updates and renewals all from within one app, and without the user ever having to directly interact with the wiki. And the best part: It&#39;s fully open source, so other civs can use it as well if they want to. The data for all citizens is queried from the wiki API. The forms are submitted to Discord as a text file, which can directly be copy-pasted into the wiki.</p><h2 id="eisvana-website-launches-27-march-2024" tabindex="-1">Eisvana Website Launches (27 March 2024) <a class="header-anchor" href="#eisvana-website-launches-27-march-2024" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Eisvana Website Launches (27 March 2024)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We have moved our most important documentation and forms to our own website. This streamlines processes like applications and feedback, and makes us independent from big companies like Google (all Google forms that were used in the past are now deprecated and have been moved to our own form system).</p><p>The website should be a place to easily find info regarding Eisvana, and to quickly navigate to our various apps.</p><h2 id="new-leadership-role-managers-2-january-2024" tabindex="-1">New Leadership Role: Managers (2 January 2024) <a class="header-anchor" href="#new-leadership-role-managers-2-january-2024" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;New Leadership Role: Managers (2 January 2024)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>To add another layer of leadership below the Bridge Crew, the &quot;Manager&quot; position is created. The idea is to split each department and other sections of Eisvana into smaller chunks, which can then be overseen by one or potentially multiple people. Multiple of these smaller chunks are then combined into one bigger department, which is in turn overseen by one Bridge member. Everyone who has been an active citizen for at least three months can apply for the manager position.</p><h2 id="pristine-planet-hunt-2-january-2024" tabindex="-1">Pristine Planet Hunt (2 January 2024) <a class="header-anchor" href="#pristine-planet-hunt-2-january-2024" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Pristine Planet Hunt (2 January 2024)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A paradise planet is wanted for a new EBC project with the working title &quot;Special Art Gallery&quot;.

This year, we are using a new the <a href="https://eisvana.github.io/Eisvana-Census/renew.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Eisvana Census Renew</a> web app to give our citizens the possibility to renew their census entries.</p><h2 id="eisvana-reaches-double-hub-status-11-december-2023" tabindex="-1">Eisvana Reaches Double Hub-Status (11 December 2023) <a class="header-anchor" href="#eisvana-reaches-double-hub-status-11-december-2023" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Eisvana Reaches Double Hub-Status (11 December 2023)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In addition to the 20 bases, there are now also 20 people with two types of ID on the census. This means a gold starburst is added to our embassy wiki page, and the size updated to HUB-R. Only few civs have achieved this size, so we are very proud of everyone who is part of Eisvana!</p><h2 id="eisvana-reaches-hub-size-9-december-2023" tabindex="-1">Eisvana Reaches Hub-Size (9 December 2023) <a class="header-anchor" href="#eisvana-reaches-hub-size-9-december-2023" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Eisvana Reaches Hub-Size (9 December 2023)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>20 Bases have been documented in Eisvana, meaning Eisvana is now officially marked as HUB-B on the wiki and has a silver starburst.</p><h2 id="participation-board-is-created-9-december-2023" tabindex="-1">Participation Board Is Created (9 December 2023) <a class="header-anchor" href="#participation-board-is-created-9-december-2023" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Participation Board Is Created (9 December 2023)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Since the participation forum worked very well in the early days of the civ, we are bringing it back in the form of the participation board.

The system name is a reference to the civ name vote back in September, where &quot;The Cadence&quot; scored second place.
